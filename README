Installation steps:
- Clone this repository
- Create folder ssl and include your certificate and key (cert.pem and key.pem)
- Type "sh build.sh" to buid a MBDA image from scratch (with empty user database)

If you don't have certificate and key, you need to comment the following lines in the Dockerfile:

# COPY ssl/key.pem .
# COPY ssl/cert.pem .
# ENTRYPOINT ["jupyterhub", "-f", "/etc/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.py", "--ssl-key", "/etc/jupyterhub/key.pem", "--ssl-cert", "/etc/jupyterhub/cert.pem"]

And uncomment the last line.
